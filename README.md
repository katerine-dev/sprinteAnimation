# spriteAnimation

Simple sprite animation project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Project

This repository was created to practice JavaScript concepts related to canvas manipulation and spritesheet animations. I'm following a [video](https://youtu.be/GFO_txvwK_c?t=5132) from the internet as the basis for my studies.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/katerine-dev/spriteAnimation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spriteAnimation
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

## Demo

Iâ€™ll soon add a GIF or video showing the animation in action.
